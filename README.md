# Introduction
<br></br>So, this is a long time coming. On December 2nd, 2015 I submitted my idea for a new play style in /r/councilofkarma. It was after we had been talking about replacing the current battle system because it was too confusing and people weren't joining. I mean, that's the reason we as a whole were talking about it; not to sound too salty, but Orangereds were talking about it for a while because we were losing a lot with no end in sight. Regardless, this method received a very positive reception from my OR peers and generally positive reception from the group as a whole. However, nothing really changed and the Council went in a different direction. The current method is based off another suggestion I had, but I'm not satisfied with that. 
<br></br>My real problem was that reostra was too nice, and no way could I eevr demand so much from someone who continually just gives and gives and gives. I knew what I had to do, I had to make my own. It also means that I can have practical knowledge on python.
